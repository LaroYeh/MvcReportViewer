# MvcReportViewer
This is a library to help with rendering a custom server Report Viewer control in ASP.NET MVC without the help of doing the ASP.NET Webforms sorcery. I'm actually using the SSRS ReportExecution api to render the report to HTML4.0 format and display the report. Currently I'm using Bootstrap 3 for the styling.
